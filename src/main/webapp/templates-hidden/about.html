		<span class="bio">CoinMines is a <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> mining pool. <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pooled_mining">Pooled mining</a> is the process of hashing the transactions that occur in the <a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> network. Successfully hashing a block of transactions results in a reward.<br/><br/>

		Pooled mining is a way for many miners to work together in the process of hashing transactions, and then split the reward among the members based on their contribution. This gives users a steady payout, eliminating some (but not all) of the luck factor.<br/><br/>
