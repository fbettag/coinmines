Successfully hashing a block of transactions results in a reward. These rewards are given out by a <strong>proportional algorythm</strong> which is split like this: <strong>(Reward * <span lift="Stats.feeFactor"></span> / Total shares this Round) * Your shares this Round</strong>. This includes the <span lift="Stats.feePercent"></span>% Pool-Fee for ensuring continuning development and server housing.<br/><br/>

		Pooled mining is a way for many miners to work together in the process of hashing transactions, and then split the reward among the members based on their contribution. This gives users a steady payout, eliminating some (but not all) of the luck factor.<br/><br/>
