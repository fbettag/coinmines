### This allows you to include other properties files by including a comma delimited list of filenames.
### The path is relative to the location of THIS properties file.
###
### This may be useful for testing/troubleshooting scenarios allowing you split database config or
### any other block of config to a seperate file for easy changes.
###
### Properties are accumlated and overwritten in order.  e.g. if the same property appears in this
### file and in one the include files the include property will take precedence.
### Included properties files can also use the include property.  File are processes by walking the tree
### e.g. this file, 1st include file, 1st include file's include file, 2nd include file.
### If you precede the list with a '!' char this will prevent conficts and throw an error if any
### included property overwrites one that is already set.  Child properties can also set this flag.
### prefix with '!!' will force the conflicts flag to be inherited and conflict flags in child properties
### will be ignored.  You can set the inheritance flag in a child properties file and it will only apply
### to children of that properties file.

### DDoS is a real threat for your pool.

### without needing to constantly poll the database.
### Currently only method support is httpget - if you can suggest any other push type methods let us know.
### get will be sent with params: ?blockchange=true&blockwon=<true|false>&source=<source.name>
### This url is not part of PoolServerJ.  You can implement a PHP page for example that will react to the call
### and do you payment processing cycle.

#notify.blockchange.method=httpget

### highly recommend this is not a publicly accessible URL or that you at least check the request is from localhost
### or you could be open to a DoS by forcing constant payout processing.

#notify.blockchange.url=http://localhost:10001/notifyblockchange-downstream

### Recommended you block this port on your firewall as well but it will ignore all requests unless from an address in 
### the allowedManagementAddresses property
### current functions supported:
### flushWorker - removes worker from cache, call this if the worker is changed by your frontend.

### Forces mgmt interface to only bind to 127.0.0.1
bindManagementInterfaceOnlyToLocahost=true
### comma delimited for multiple addresses.  This doesn't affect interface bindings, it it verification after the request is received.
### If bindManagementInterfaceOnlyToLocahost=true this won't work for any addresses other than localhost.
### If bindManagementInterfaceOnlyToLocahost=false and you only have 127.0.0.1 as an allowed addres external client can still hit the
## interface but will get an unauthorized response.
### 
allowedManagementAddresses=127.0.0.1

### Immediately after a block change is the busiest time for both your server and the upstream server trying to refill
### caches with fresh work.  If set true this will allow the weightings to be temporarily skewed by servicing downstream
### requests from any source that fresh work available.  The weightings should even up after a short while but if you
### have slower pool members that take a long time to process blocks chances are the slower members will spend more time
### processing work from local sources than the weighting specifies and high speed members will be wieghted more towards
### remote blocks.  Setting to false will mean it takes slightly longer to fill all the getwork requests immediately after
### a block change.  Whether either scenario is better than the other is up to you.

### In seconds.  Period to cache workers in memory to avoid constant hits to the database.  You can set this to a long value if you

### This also caches unknown usernames to protect against a flood of database hits from unregistered workers.
workerCacheExpiry=3600

### When work is issued a unique portion is stored internally in a map.  This map can grow very large.
### If a worker submits work and it is not in this map an 'unknown-work' response will be issued unless
### the work is in the previous block's map in which case a 'stale-work' will be issued.
### pushpoold has a hardcoded cache timeout of 120 seconds.  So it's reasonable to expect that most miners
### will not try to retain work for longer than this period.  Shorten it at your peril.

### The range provides enough space that miner doesn't run out of nonces in 1 second we can
### pad the nonce range to allow some headroom.
### basically this number is the approximate number of seconds the noncerange should last for
### before the miner uses up all the nonce space.  If rollNTime is enabled then 2 should be
### plenty of headroom.  If not then you'll probably want a much bigger number like 120
### so the worker doesn't need to refresh work for 2 minutes.
### set to -1 to disable nonceRange
#nonceRangePaddingFactor=20.0

### This is the period (in seconds) that the miner is allowed to roll the timestamp of the delivered
### work and still have it considered valid when submitted as a share
### THIS MUST BE <= maxAgeToMapWorkSource.  If it is not then work entries may be deleted from the work map
### whilst the miner is still working on it and when it does eventually submit it will receive a 'stale'. 
### It is recommended to set this a few seconds below maxAgeToMapWorkSource.

### if you want to replace the standard engines for authetication with different implementations
### you can set these options.  You must specify the engines using the fully qualified class name
### If specifying a custom engine you provide an engine with specific constructor signature
### as the engine are instantiated by reflection.

### This engine manages the fetching of workers from the database (or whereever else you want to
### store them.
### Required Constructor signature: (String[] extraParams)
#db.engine.workerFetch=com.shadworld.poolserver.db.worker.WorkerDBFetchEngine

### This allows some extra config of your custom engine. It is a comma delimited list
### which will be passed to your constructor as an array of strings (String[] extraParams).  An empty
### entry in the list i.e. 'param1,,param3' will be passed as an empty string
### If you require non String arguments you must parse these into the appropriate type in
### you constructor.  e.g. Integer.parseInt(extraParams[0]);
### Sorry no escape char.  If you need to use a delimited list as one of your params you'll need
### to use a different delimiter.
#db.engine.workerFetch.extraParamps=param1,,param3

### This engine allows for customised Authentication behaviour.  Not really a database engine
### but better to keep them all together. 
### Required Constructor signature: (WorkerProxy workerProxy, String[] extraParams)
#authenticatorEngine=com.shadworld.poolserver.servlet.auth.WorkerAuthenticator
### @see comments for #db.engine.workerFetch.extraParams property
#authenticatorEngine.extraParams=param1,param2,param3

#authenticatorEngine.extraParams=true,false

### This engine handles logging of shares to database (it is separate from file and stdout logging)
### Required Constructor signature: (ShareLogger shareLogger, String tempFilename, String[] extraParams)
#db.engine.shareLogging=com.shadworld.poolserver.db.shares.DefaultPreparedStatementSharesDBFlushEngine

### @see comments for #db.engine.workerFetch.extraParams property

#    Database Connections      #
################################

### Shares and Workers operation use two seperate connections internally.  By default
### these both use the same set of parameters.  If you want to use different connections
### you specify either some or all connection parameters individually.
### The set of parameters that can be set like this are:
### db.engine, db.host, db.port, db.name, db.schema, db.file, db.user, db.password, db.url
###
### To customise a parameter simply add a new property in the following format:
### db.shares.schema=shares_schema or sb.worker.schema=worker_schema
###
### The config process will first check for a customised parameter and if not present
### will fall back to the standard parameter i.e. db.schema
### If you only want to change one you can use the standard parameters for all except the
### one that differs.  

db.column.username=username
db.column.password=password
db.column.id=id
### this column should contain a comma delimited list of ip addresses or hostnames.
### if this property is not set then host validation will be disabled.

### 
### These are your sources of work.  Local sources are typically bitcoin daemons.
### 
### You can have more than one of either type of source.  For example your bitcoin daemon may be struggling to keep
### up with requests so you can run a 2nd daemon on another machine and use it as a 2nd source to speed up your getwork
### delivery.  
###
### If you do have more than a single source it is recommended
### that you add a 'source' column to your shares table in your database so you can track which source winning blocks
### came from.
### 
### To use multiple sources simply use a different numbered prefix for each of the properties.
### i.e. source.local.1.name=local bitcoin daemon1
###      source.local.2.name=local bitcoin daemon2
### Make sure you do this for each of the properties for that source and make sure you give them all unique names
